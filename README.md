 # Aunesty Moreland - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
Hi, My name is Aunesty, I am a data analyst and I am currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science (B.S. Computer Science). Beginning with the study of computer programming languages, I embarked on my journey in the tech industry, which laid a robust foundation for my career in data analysis and strategic marketing. My relevant coursework has equipped me with skills in statistical analysis, professional technical writing, analytical mathematics and data-driven decision-making.

 Inspired by the elegance and resilience of the lotus flower, I strive to uncover the hidden truths within data sets. Utilizing advanced data analysis techniques, I cultivate insights that drive marketing success. Just as the lotus rises from the mud to bloom beautifully, I aim to transform complex data into clear, actionable strategies.

## Portfolio Projects
Here, I will provide a quick overview of various data analytic projects or tutorials I have completed.

## Fall Studio AI
**Code:**[Fall Studio AI](https://github.com/Aunestly/Fall-AI-Studio-Project/blob/main/README.md#fall-ai-studio-project)

## Using dplyr to Analyze Archipelago Penguin Dataset by Jesse Mostipak
**Code:** [`Using dplyr to Analyze Archipelago Penguin Dataset by Jesse Mostipak.ipynb`](https://github.com/Aunestly/aun-m_portfolio/blob/main/Using%20dplyr%20to%20Analyze%20Archipelago%20Penguin%20Dataset%20by%20Jesse%20Mostipak.ipynb)

**Goal:** Use five dplyr functions to filter and analyze different species of penguins from the archipelago dataset.

**Description:** This project is a tutorial that I completed that includes a dataset with 3 species of penguins; Chinstrap, Ad√©lie, or Gentoo from the islands of Dream, Torgersen, or Biscoe in the Palmer Archipelago, (Antarctica). To discover the average body mass by species AND island I utilized the Tidyverse package dplyr and five functions into ggplot2 package for visualization. In this tutorial by Jesse Mostipak that I completed I was able to set up the coding environment, load the necessary packages, explore the data, and model it. 

**Skills:** data modeling, data exploration, data parsing, data visualization, data importing
