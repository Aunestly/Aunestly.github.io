## About This Project

This is a fully responsive portfolio website built to showcase my projects, skills, and experience in data analysis and computer science. It features a interactive design with a separate landing page and main content page for a nice user experience.

## File Structure

-   `index.html`: The main splash/landing page that serves as the entry point.
-   `portfolio.html`: The main portfolio page containing the "About Me," "Projects," and "Contact" sections.
-   `index.css`: Contains all styling for both pages, including the high-tech theme, animations, and responsive design.
-   `index.js`: Handles all client-side interactivity on the `portfolio.html` page, such as the 3D cards, scroll animations, and background effects.
-   `profile.png`: The profile picture used on the site.
