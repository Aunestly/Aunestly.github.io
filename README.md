# Aunesty Moreland - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
Hi, My name is Aunesty, I am a data analyst and I am currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science (B.S. Computer Science). Beginning with the study of computer programming languages, I embarked on my journey in the tech industry, which laid a robust foundation for my career in data analysis and strategic marketing. My relevant coursework has equipped me with skills in statistical analysis, professional technical writing, analytical mathematics and data-driven decision-making.

 Inspired by the elegance and resilience of the lotus flower, I strive to uncover the hidden truths within data sets. Utilizing advanced data analysis techniques, I cultivate insights that drive marketing success. Just as the lotus rises from the mud to bloom beautifully, I aim to transform complex data into clear, actionable strategies.
